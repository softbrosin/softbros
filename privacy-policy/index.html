  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="lead">Effective date: <strong>13-11-2025</strong></p>
  <p class="lead">This Privacy Policy applies to the <strong>Softbros IN</strong> multi-instance B2B app (the "App").</p>
</header>

<section>
  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome — Softbros IN ("we", "us", "our") builds a single app that hosts separate instances for each business we serve.
    This policy explains what information we collect, how we use and protect it, and the choices available to users.
    The App is provided to businesses (our customers) who create their own instances; each instance has separate data and configuration.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>2. Summary (Short)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We host separate instances per business; data is stored separately per instance.</li>
    <li>The App uses device-based biometric authentication (Face / Fingerprint) but we <strong>do not</strong> collect or store biometric data.</li>
    <li>Users must enter an Instance ID to access their business instance and must enable notifications to receive owner updates.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>3. Data We Collect</h2>

  <h3>3.1 Data you provide</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Instance ID:</strong> entered by the user to join their business instance.</li>
    <li><strong>Support messages:</strong> any messages or attachments you send to business support.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3.2 Device & technical data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Device identifiers (device model, OS version, app version).</li>
    <li>Network and diagnostic data (error reports, performance metrics).</li>
    <li>Push notification token (so we can deliver notifications to your device).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3.3 Biometric & authentication</h3>
  <p>
    The App uses the device's built-in biometric APIs for authentication (face, fingerprint). We <strong>do not</strong> collect, process, or store biometric templates or raw biometric data.
    Biometric verification is handled locally by the device's secure system (e.g., Android BiometricPrompt / KeyStore). We rely on the device's native security to confirm identity.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>4. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To authenticate users and provide secure access to the correct instance.</li>
    <li>To deliver push notifications and updates from the user’s business owner.</li>
    <li>To store and present data that belongs to your business instance (orders, account info, settings).</li>
    <li>To troubleshoot problems, analyze performance, and maintain app stability.</li>
    <li>To comply with legal obligations or respond to legal requests.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>5. Data Segregation & Instance Model</h2>
  <p>
    Each business receives a separate instance. Data, databases, and configurations are segregated per-instance so that one business's data is never mixed with another's. The business owner controls instance-level settings and the user data permitted in that instance.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>6. Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not share instance data with other Softbros customers.</li>
    <li>We may share data with third-party service providers necessary to operate the App (hosting, analytics, push notifications). See <em>Third-party services</em> below.</li>
    <li>We will disclose information to comply with legal obligations or respond to lawful requests.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Third-party services:</strong> We may use third-party services, Firebase Cloud Messaging, Railway Hosting, Hostinger. These services are governed by their own privacy policies.
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>7. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable administrative, technical, and physical steps to protect data. Measures include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Encryption in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and encryption at rest where applicable.</li>
    <li>Device-based authentication and secure key storage via platform security APIs.</li>
    <li>Access controls and role-based access for our operations team and for business owners.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Important:</strong> Because the App relies on the device’s biometric system, the device owner’s security settings and OS updates affect the strength of authentication.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>8. Notifications</h2>
  <p>
    To receive updates from a business owner, users must enable Notification Access. We store a push token to route notifications to the correct device. You can revoke notification permission in your device settings at any time.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain data for as long as needed to provide services for the business instance, and to comply with legal obligations. Retention periods may be set by the business owner for certain data types. If you request deletion, we will follow the business owner's policies or, if applicable, delete data in accordance with applicable law and our retention procedures.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>10. Your Rights & Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access & correction:</strong> You can request access to or correction of your personal data via the business owner or by contacting us.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete:</strong> You may request deletion of your personal account data; note that deletion requests typically go through the business owner who manages the instance.</li>
    <li><strong>Opt-out:</strong> You can disable notifications in device settings or uninstall the App to stop data collection from new activity.</li>
    <li><strong>Data portability:</strong> If applicable by law, you may request a copy of your personal data in a portable format.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To exercise these rights, contact: <strong>support@softbros.in</strong></p>

<section>
  <h2>11. Children</h2>
  <p>
    The App is intended for business users and is not directed to children under 13 (or under the age applicable in your jurisdiction). If you believe we have collected data from a child in violation of law, contact us and we will take steps to remove that data.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>12. International Transfers</h2>
  <p>
    Data may be processed or stored in locations outside your country. When we transfer data internationally we will follow applicable legal requirements and implement appropriate safeguards.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>13. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post changes in the App and update the effective date above. Significant changes will be notified to business owners and, where appropriate, to end users.
